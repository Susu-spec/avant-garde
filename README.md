## Disclaimer
This project is not an actual store, it is fictional and uses a photo of the original contraption (albeit artwork) by Marcel Duchamp (one of the most critically acclaimed conceptual artworks of the 20th century). Marcel Duchampâ€™s Fountain (1917) was a porcelain urinal turned into a statement on what constitutes art. For more information, [read here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)).
